Overall we follow the Google JavaScript Style Guide with the following exceptions:
 * We do not use JSDoc and Google specific annotations for now. Thus, the corresponding sections can be ignored.
 * Because of bugger and better displays we agree to allow a line length of 140 characters.

To enforce the conventions/coding rules we use JSCS which automatically verifies all changed JS-files during the build based on the following rule set:
